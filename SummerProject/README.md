# Summer Project

The summer project consisted of 4 parts. 

Full details are in pdf file [here](./APCSA_summerProj_2021.pdf)

<br>

## ```.java``` and ```.class``` files

The ```.java``` files are located in the [src](./src) folder. These are editable files to be used in any Java IDE (Integrated Development Environment) such as [Eclipse](https://www.eclipse.org/ide/) or [IntelliJ](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/)

The ```.class``` files are located in the [bin](./bin) folder. These files contain java bytecode to be executed by a JVM (Java Virtual Machine). These are automatically generated when the ```.java``` file is compiled.  

<br><i>
**NOTE:** If you have never worked with ```.class``` files before, you do not need to worry about them. The ```.java``` files have all the necessary code.
